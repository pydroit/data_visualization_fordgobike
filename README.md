# data_visualization_fordgobike

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

## Exploratory Data Visualization 

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.


## Explanatory Data Visualization

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in the FordGoBike Dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings was through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
