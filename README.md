# Ford GoBike System Analysis

## Dataset
The dataset which was gotten  [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQmkX4iOT6Rcrin42vslquX2_wQCjIa_hbwD0xmxrERPSOJYDtpNc_3wwK_p9_KpOsfA6QVyEHdxxq7/pub?embedded=True) includes a February 2019 information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Details such as the total duration of each subscriber's (or customer's) trip is located alongside the location where the trip started and where the trip ended.

The dataset is a single csv file which was assessed, cleaned and analyzed.



## Summary of Findings

The Subscribers are of younger age and they made shorter duration trips. Their age ranged between 25 and 30 years old, and they mostly did 3 to 10 minutes rides. In contrast, the customers who are casual riders were mostly between the ages of 29 and 39, and did as much as 20 minutes ride duration and even beyond.

Customers (Casual riders) have only few minutes of ride, compared to the subscribers that have access to at least 45 minutes of ride. However, customers had longer duration of minutes compared to the subscribers whose duration was generally shorter. In an attempt to explain this, customers probably want to maximise the opportunity they have to ride, and might be tourists taking leisure rides. This might be why the rides are longer than subscribers.

Evaluating the relationship between gender and ride duration, there seems to be no difference, as both genders perform as well as the other.

Finally , a surprising observation however was the pattern of weekends. The weekends had fewer rides than weekdays, and the peak time of the day people take rides on weekends was at mid-day towards afternoon.


## Key Insights for Presentation
My focus is on the behavioural patterns of the riders (subscribers and customers). The Ford GoBike provides both subscription services, and casual ride service (customers who make no subscription). I differentiate between the habits of the subscribers as against the customers. I then explore the duration of rides, days most rides were made and even differentiated between weekday habits and weekend habits which yielded much revelation. I used heatmaps for my bivi=ariate and multivariate analysis make the analysis more convenient to understand at a glance.
